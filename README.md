#### Chorus Honey

![chorus_honey_bottle](https://github.com/HestiMae/pollinators-paradise/assets/62225435/cf64b02c-cc84-4bd0-9c92-eb3b0b794bc8)
A strange nectar brewed from honey with the forbidden chorus fruit of _The End_.

Teleports the player upwards through nearby ceilings. Great for caving!

#### Chorus Honey Blocks

Retains the strange properties of chorus honey in a crystallised form, causing entities to slide upward into the air.

### Apiarist's Set
*Beekeeping attire for the aspiring adventure-apiarist.*<br/>
*These articles sport little in the way of protection, but are unbreakable.*<br/>
Mostly made from _waxed wool_, a composite wool loosened with honey.

When drizzled with a bit of honey from a bottle, it can be drained to perform **special abilities**.<br/>
A water bottle can wash out the honey for reuse.

**Apiarist's Veil**<br/>

*Chorus | **Bee Allies***: Angers bees towards hostiles targeting you.<br/>
*Bees will only be angered if it's safe for them to attack - see below!*

**Apiarist's Leggings**<br/>
*Honey | **Honey Climber***: Allows bounding up honey blocks, and being tossed away from chorus honey blocks.<br/>
*Chorus | **Pollen Pants***: Allows pollinating crops - just like bees do!<br/>

![apiarist_wellies](https://github.com/HestiMae/pollinators-paradise/assets/62225435/9bfd4619-c4b2-4de0-a58c-dc270a512517)
**Apiarist's Wellies**<br/>
*Milled from waxed copper, with honeycomb block soles.*<br/>
*Empty | **Slippery When Dry***: The waxed soles cause slipping and sliding on all surfaces.<br/>
*Honey | **Honey Block Crystallise***: Resist knocks and attacks by sneaking to crystallise against below honey blocks. Or build elastic energy from chorus honey blocks!<br/>
*Chorus | **Faithwalking***: Slide far past the edge of cliffs, but don't look down!

![apiarist_shears](https://github.com/HestiMae/pollinators-paradise/assets/62225435/f24a9d1c-ab14-458b-9afd-033e39c2e906)
**Apiarist's Shears**<br/>
*Psst, are you with the bee union?*

This hardy set of shears made from waxed copper blocks is familiar to bees, and **won't anger them.**<br/>
*Honey | **Nest Harvesters***: Wild pollinators dwelling in nests provide you extra each harvest.<br/>
*Chorus | **Nest Scavengers***: Scavenger drones operating from nests share local resources each harvest.

![apiarist_wand-1](https://github.com/HestiMae/pollinators-paradise/assets/62225435/94884a94-26b0-4ace-8c15-f5d5c28feb53)
**Honeyed Wand**<br/>
Instilled with pollen magic, this tool can't be honeyed itself, but drains honey drizzled on clothes and the off-hand.

*Draining Honey*: Inflicts **magical honey damage** to hurt mobs and heal bees!<br/>
*Draining Chorus*: Harnesses the strange power of chorus honey to **fling enemies** to the ground, dealing fall damage!

## Mechanics

### Beecons

Beacons with a honey block staining their beam become *beecons*, which affect both players and bees.

As an upshot - bees are also affected by more status effects!<br>
*Haste*: Bees process honey in hives faster.<br/>
*Strength*: Bees inflict Poison II, or Wither II at level II.<br/>
*Resistance/Regeneration*: As well as their base effect, bees will survive regrowing their stingers.<br/>
*Speed*: Bees fly more erratically, and debatably faster.<br/>

If you're extra worried about bee welfare, [feed the bees](https://modrinth.com/mod/feed-the-bees) prevents stinger death altogether and adds direct healing via sugar.
