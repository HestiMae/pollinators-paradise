## New Stuff

#### Apiarist's Set
*Beekeeping attire for the aspiring adventure-apiarist.*

These articles sport little in the way of protection, but provide costly utility.

Most pieces are made from a composite wax-honey-wool material, *honeyed wool*.

**Apiarist's Veil**<br/>
*When Honeyed*: Calms bees targeting the wearer.<br/>
*When ■■■■■■ed*: NYI.

**Apiarist's Suit**<br/>
*When Honeyed*: Immobilizes attackers in honey.<br/>
*When ■■■■■■ed*: NYI.

**Apiarist's Leggings**<br/>
*When Honeyed*: Allows wall-jumping up honey blocks.<br/>
*When ■■■■■■ed*: NYI.

**Apiarist's Wellies**<br/>
*Milled from full waxed copper blocks, and full honeycomb blocks for the soles.*<br/>
*When Honeyed*: Crystallises against honey blocks while sneaking, improving defense. Allows jumping easily on honey.<br/>
*When ■■■■■■ed*: NYI.

#### Apiarist's Shears

This hardy set of shears made from honeycomb blocks is familiar to bees.<br/>
*When Honeyed*: Won't anger wild or hived bees on collection. Can collect more honeycombs from nests.<br/>
*When ■■■■■■ed*: NYI.

#### Honeyed Wand

Instilled with the magic of pollen, this tool can't be honeyed itself, but draws from the honey on your hands and clothes.

*When Draining Honey*: Deals magical honey damage based on the amount of honey in all equipment.<br/>
*When Draining ■■■■■■*: NYI.

## Mechanics

### Honeying

Honeyable equipment is unbreakable, but is more functional when drizzled and soaked in *honey*, right from honey bottles in the inventory.

Most equipment can soak up to four bottles of honey, but some might drain faster than others with use.

A bottle of water can be used to remove all honey from a piece of equipment - but why would you want that?

### Beecons

Beacons with a honey block staining their beam become *beecons*, which affect both players and bees.

As an upshot - bees are also affected by more status effects!<br>
*Haste*: Bees process honey in hives faster.<br/>
*Strength*: Bees inflict poison II, or Wither II at level II.<br/>
*Resistance/Regeneration*: As well as their base effect, bees will survive regrowing their stingers.<br/>
*Speed*: Bees fly more erratically, and debatably faster.<br/>
