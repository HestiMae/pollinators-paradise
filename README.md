#### Chorus Honey

A strange nectar brewed from honey with the forbidden chorus fruit of _The End_.

*When Consumed*: Teleports the player upwards through nearby ceilings. Great for caving!

#### Chorus Honey Blocks

Retains the strange properties of chorus honey in a crystallised form, causing entities to slide upward into the air.

### Apiarist's Set
*Beekeeping attire for the aspiring adventure-apiarist. - These articles sport little in the way of protection, but are unbreakable.*

Mostly made from _waxed wool_, a composite wool loosened with honey.

When drizzled with a bit of honey from a bottle, each article grains improved stats has special uses that drain honey. They similarly be washed with water to apply a different honey.

**Apiarist's Veil**<br/>
*Honey | Bee Calm*: Calms bees targeting the wearer.<br/>
*Chorus | Bee Allies*: Angers bees towards those targeting the wearer<br/>
*Bees will only be angered if it's safe for them to attack - see below!*

**Apiarist's Suit**<br/>
*Honey | Sticky Thorns*: Immobilizes attackers in honey.<br/>
*Chorus | Chorus Dodge*: Half of all projectiles simply miss.<br/>

**Apiarist's Leggings**<br/>
*Honey | Honey Climber*: Allows bounding up honey blocks, and tossed away from chorus honey blocks.<br/>
*Chorus | Pollen Pants*: Allows pollinating crops - just like bees do!<br/>

**Apiarist's Wellies**<br/>
*Milled from waxed copper, with honeycomb block soles.*<br/>
*Empty | Slippery When Dry*: These waxed soles cause slipping and sliding on all surfaces.<br/>
*Honey | Honey Block Crystallise*: Resist knocks and attacks by sneaking to crystallise against below honey blocks. Or build up the elastic energy of chorus honey blocks!<br/>
*Chorus | Faithwalking*: Slide far past the edge of cliffs, but don't look down!

#### Apiarist's Shears

*Psst, are you with the bee union?*

This hardy set of shears made from waxed copper blocks is familiar to bees, and won't anger them.<br/>
*Honey | Nest Harvesters*: Wild pollinators dwelling in nests provide you more honeycomb each harvest<br/>
*Chorus | Nest Scavengers*: Scavenger drones operating from nests share local resources each harvest.

#### Honeyed Wand

Instilled with pollen magic, this tool can't be honeyed itself, but draws from all honey on your hands and clothes.

*When Draining Honey*: Inflicts magical honey damage to hurt mobs and heal bees!<br/>
*When Draining Chorus Honey*: Harnesses the strange power of chorus honey to fling enemies to the ground, dealing fall damage!

## Mechanics

### Beecons

Beacons with a honey block staining their beam become *beecons*, which affect both players and bees.

As an upshot - bees are also affected by more status effects!<br>
*Haste*: Bees process honey in hives faster.<br/>
*Strength*: Bees inflict Poison II, or Wither II at level II.<br/>
*Resistance/Regeneration*: As well as their base effect, bees will survive regrowing their stingers.<br/>
*Speed*: Bees fly more erratically, and debatably faster.<br/>

If you're extra worried about bee welfare, [feed the bees](https://modrinth.com/mod/feed-the-bees) prevents stinger death altogether and adds direct healing via sugar.
